# Rainydays

2022_HTML-CSS_CA_HMA_rainy-days

## Description

A webshop for his and hers jackets made for educational purposes.

## Changes made from the figma design:

- Removed quick buy button from product list/cards.

- Product counter is non-functional because I could not figure out if it was even doable with HTML and CSS only.

- Card hover removed because it bugged out the flexbox.

- Checkout cta's moved to have the name:required function with the input:submit.

- Added checkmark to the L size checkbox. Only added this one because I used "Large" on the checkout page.

- Tried to make nav sticky but I couldn't get it to work right with my design so I decided to let it stay on top.
*after review I have made it fixed and moved the logo underneath the header instead of having it on top of it like designed.*
