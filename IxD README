Having very little feedback on the page I had to work with what I had and try to add the missing interactivity with javascript.

- Feedback:. Maybe adjust colors to "make more modern".
- Action: Changed the dark brown to a black seethrough. And adjusted opacity on nav and footer to match.

- Feedback: From font size hard to read to some.
- Action:

**JavaScript**
Built an object array with the products. Utilizing local storage to move data around.
Index.html buttons pass value to local storage which is fetched and used to generate the productlist page and productpage H1.
